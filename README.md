# convinci.ng [source]
The source code, unfiltered, of convinci.ng, my personal website.

### General Info
This was a quick edit of my slightly older site, as it was stolen and duplicated a bunch of times and my little brain got angery.

Although it doesn't function properly in scaling, I am very proud of the layout!

If you decide to use this for your own website, please leave a mention to my website or this GitHub page! <3
